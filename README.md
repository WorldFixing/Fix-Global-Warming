# Fix-Global-Warming
Non-Technological, Easy to Understand, Easy to Implement, Guaranteed to Work, Slideshow

Here we have a Simple slideshow (15-16 slides or so) that proposes a Non-Technological Solution
to the Global Warming aspect of Climate Change. This Project has no side-effects
as most Technical Solutions do, and in fact actually helps us all by
Sequestering Carbon Dioxide(CO2) while Producing Oxygen(O2) at roughly the rate of 1.5/1.  

If you think this presentation has merit, please share with your friends and associates.
We are actively seeking contributors to help, little tasks or big, we all must start somewhere.

Just uploaded, a detailed table by Country (248) showing the Total number of Trees needed
to offset the CO2 according to the IPCC Report (Oct 8, 2018) 45% reduction by 2030 followed by 
55% reduction to Zero CO2 by 2050. This ONE YEAR Project does just that!

So much Technical work needed, though. Monitoring tools, Tracking seed/seedling production,
financial contributions, etc.

Once again, we are actively seeking contributors to help, little tasks or big,
we all need to start somewhere.

Apr 5, 2019 - Major Breakthrough on Project, reducing the Time to complete, plus additional
benefits for those below the poverty line (BTPL) in each Tropical country. Please read one page overview
