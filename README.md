# Fix-Global-Warming
Non-Technological, Easy to Understand, Easy to Implement, Guaranteed to Work, Slideshow

Here we have a Simple slideshow (15-16 slides or so) that proposes a Non-Technological Solution
to the Global Warming aspect of Climate Change. This Project has no side-effects
as most Technical Solutions do, and in fact actually helps us all by
Sequestering Carbon Dioxide(CO2) while Producing Oxygen(O2) at roughly the rate of 1.5/1.  

If you think this presentation has merit, please share with your friends and associates.
